# Welcome!

Each folder has a collection of 20 sample programs that are intended to give you a 
good idea of the breadth and depth of my programming experience for that year.  
This is not a comprehensive list by any means, but should provide a meaningful understanding 
of my problem solving and C++ abilities.

# What to Expect

Each sample file has a general format:
```
// Problem Name
// Problem Credits

// Problem Description
/*
    <description>
*/

// Solution Description
/*
    <description>
*/

# Credits

Most of the solutions use code from a reference document (kactl).  Link to the document:  
https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl/blob/main/kactl.pdf

All C++ solutions utilize part of the starting template from kactl.
