# Welcome

These 20 sample programs are intended to give the reader a good idea of the breadth and depth of my
programming experience as a competitive programmer.  This is not a comprehensive list by any means,
but should provide a meaningful understanding of my problem solving and C++ abilities.

# What to Expect

Each sample file has a general format:
```
// Problem Name
// Problem Credits

// Problem Description
/*
    <description>
*/

// Solution Description
/*
    <description>
*/

Solution Code
```

The solution programs are generally between 100-200 lines of code and follow the coding standards for competitive programmers.  The general problem and solution ideas can be seen in the Problem Tags section below.
