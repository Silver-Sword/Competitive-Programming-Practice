# Credits

All C++ solutions utilize part of the starting template from kactl. 
Each of the following programs uses template code from kactl:
 <!-- - openpitmining.cpp uses Edmonds Karp
 - passwordsuspect.cpp uses Aho Corasick
 - pushabox.cpp uses connected components 
 - spanning.cpp uses the Union Find data structure
 - standingout.cpp uses the Suffix Array data structure
 - triangles.cpp uses the Point structure -->
